4Subsea Documentation Template
==============================
This is a documentation template generated by Sphinx based on the `PyData Sphinx Theme`_.

The template is intended for all 4subsea Python packages, but is also suitable for 
other applications. Using this template ensures that the documentation web site
follows the 4Subsea profile. Style and format is approved by marketing, and any changes
shall be approved by marketing before published.

Requirements
------------
The landing page shall always give a brief description of the purpose. For instance,
if the documentation is for a Python package, then the overall description and the objectives
of the package is outlined using a human-friendly language.

The "logo" shall point to the landing page.

The following sections shall always be present (and displayed on the navigation bar):

   * Getting Started
   * User Guide
   * API Reference
   * *(Optional Sections)*
   * Release Notes
   * Support

Other optional sections may be added between **API Reference** and **Release Notes** if deemed necesseary.
