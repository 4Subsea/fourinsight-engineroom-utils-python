4Insight EngineRoom Utilites for Python
=======================================

We believe that too much time and effort goes into tedious coding exercises just to even make a
simple script "work" reliably. Imagine what can be acheived if all this effort was
put into delivering high-impact insight with your next `4Insight EngineRoom`_ applications!

Our objective is maximize the time you spend on writing code that improves the engineering- and 
business-logic of your application! :mod:`fourinsight.engineroom.utils` is a collection of utilities
that we think will aid you in writing reliable and efficient applications, and speed-up the development
process.

Here, a thorough walkthrough of useful concepts and included utilities is given. Some best practices
are also suggested along the way!

However, don't let the suggerstions and recommendataions provided here be a road block
on your path to new insight! One size does not fit all! :mod:`fourinsight.engineroom.utils` is just
meant to aid you in the development of your own *EngineRoom* application. If you don't find any of the
concepts and utilities useful, then don't use them! *EngineRoom* will still be able to run your Python
application - as long as you meet the minimum requirements.
